Here are some projects that I have done. 
## Personal Project

#### Credit Card Fraud Detection
Created a classification model to detect fraud transactions with accuracy of 97% and F1 score of 80%
Worked imbalanced dataset with 0.72% of fraud transactions by using XGBoost and SMOTE. [code](https://github.com/mytran2111/Credit_card_fraud_detection)

[Digit Recognizer](https://mytran2111.github.io/DigitRecognizer_web_demo/)

[NLP Tweet Disaster Detection]()

[To Do List](https://mytran2111.github.io/to_do_list/)

Created a to-do list web app, inspired by Microsoft To Do. The web app allows user to add new tasks, mark as finished and also remove tasks added. [code](https://github.com/mytran2111/to_do_list)


[Calculator app](https://mytran2111.github.io/calculator_app/)

Created a basic calculator app, inspired by Google Calculator. [code](https://github.com/mytran2111/calculator_app)


[Flappy Bird](https://mytran2111.github.io/flappy_bird/)

Created a 2D demo of Flappy Bird with p5.js [code](https://github.com/mytran2111/flappy_bird)


## Group Project

[Web Whiteboard](https://mytran2111.github.io/Code-Jam-2020/) - Code Jam 2020 3rd place



#### Modified MNIST - 1st place 
Worked in a team with Ricky Chen, Peter Guanhua Rong for MAIS202 Kaggle Compeition. 
Created algorithm with 5 layers convolution neural network to identify the largest numerical value in pictures that contains 3 handwritten numerical digits. 
Implemented Image Data Generator using Keras library with some data preprocessing methods which allowed us to reach the accuracy of 98%.
